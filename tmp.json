            "description": "It is not ok that we speed weeks, even months, trying to solve why software is slow. It should not take more than a week to identify the root cause or causes for a performance issue, such that any performance issue reported on a Monday should be solved by Friday, or sooner.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores the dream of “fast by Friday,” and shows how kernel technologies like eBPF, and performance methodologies, can get us there. The end goal is not more tools and metrics or having everyone learn eBPF bytecode. It’s about efficient computing, and solving inefficiencies as quickly as possible to save cycles and carbon.\r\n\r\nTo be fast by Friday requires observability tools to work on Monday, and right now for many Linux environments that means /proc, Ftrace, or perf, and rarely the eBPF tracing tools: bcc and bpftrace. This and other current and future technical challenges will be discussed, including eBPF stack walking, runtime behavior, and uprobes.",

In this talk, we present a solution that integrates advanced ML processing within the Linux kernel to provide intelligent fast packet inspection. Concretely, by exploiting the TinyML paradigm and the characteristics of eBPF, we have implemented a complex model such as a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) in kernel space. This proposal allows to significantly reduce processing latencies compared to similar solutions implemented outside the kernel, as well as enabling the deployment of advanced network functions in a flexible and dynamic way on devices not specialized in network management tasks.",

Normal traffic sniffing collects the encrypted data and has no means to access the original payload. This inhibits traditional tracing tools and complicates debugging systems when critical issues arise.\r\n\r\nTo address this, eBPF tools probe user space to regain access to the plaintext data. While these approaches are exciting, scaling this type of instrumentation presents a new set of difficulties due to the variety of library choices, possible versions of each library and type of linking.\r\n\r\nWe present the techniques developed to reliably trace TLS applications across a wide array of conditions found in real-life applications. This allows Pixie to trace both BoringSSL and OpenSSL and reduces the maintenance for supporting new library versions compared to the previous tracing. We conclude by noting the coverage challenges that remain and our future plans",

However it's less straightforward to use eBPF for a proactive defense, stopping attacks immediately rather than simply alerting SOC analysts that concerning things are happening on a machine. Is this possible within the limitations of eBPF?\r\n\r\nThis session showcases a proof-of-concept that uses eBPF to detect and even prevent stack pivoting, a popular ROP exploitation technique. We'll briefly review ROP exploitation and stack pivots, and explore the possibility of using eBPF to kill ROP exploits using stack pivots as they happen.",

Because eBPF provides low-overhead observability and the means to modify system state at a fine grain (per socket policies etc), it is a great fit for this problem space. Currently bpftune focuses on networking-related tunables as a starting point but it is pluggable and extensible. Here we aim to describe the goals of bpftune, methods used and discuss possible future directions.  Some of the methods used may be of more general interest; for example online correlational analysis in eBPF is a useful technique that can help automate observability-driven decision-making and drilldown. In addition, bpftune showcases a number of types of eBPF programs so the availability of the code may hopefully help developers learning eBPF too.",

It should not take more than a week to identify the root cause or causes for a performance issue, such that any performance issue reported on a Monday should be solved by Friday, or sooner.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores the dream of “fast by Friday,” and shows how kernel technologies like eBPF, and performance methodologies, can get us there. The end goal is not more tools and metrics or having everyone learn eBPF bytecode. It’s about efficient computing, and solving inefficiencies as quickly as possible to save cycles and carbon.\r\n\r\nTo be fast by Friday requires observability tools to work on Monday, and right now for many Linux environments that means /proc, Ftrace, or perf, and rarely the eBPF tracing tools: bcc and bpftrace. This and other current and future technical challenges will be discussed, including eBPF stack walking, runtime behavior, and uprobes.",

Less than 1% of developers may actually program something in eBPF, but the vast majority will still benefit from it. People will recognize eBPF not by name, but by capability: through solutions that will be able to do things that are only currently “too good to be true”. \r\n\r\nThis talk lays out how we get there.\r\n\r\n",

In this talk, we present a solution that integrates advanced ML processing within the Linux kernel to provide intelligent fast packet inspection. Concretely, by exploiting the TinyML paradigm and the characteristics of eBPF, we have implemented a complex model such as a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) in kernel space. This proposal allows to significantly reduce processing latencies compared to similar solutions implemented outside the kernel, as well as enabling the deployment of advanced network functions in a flexible and dynamic way on devices not specialized in network management tasks.",

Invasive monitoring can harm performance, while incomplete coverage may cause unpredictable fault response times.

Despite the complexity and lack of standardized specifications for business protocols, such as those in sensitive industries like finance and securities, we can leverage eBPF in conjunction with WebAssembly plugins to parse these protocols.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate how the combination of eBPF and WebAssembly plugins can be used to parse private security protocols and provide zero code observability with full coverage for the core applications of a specific bank.

              "description": "TLS adoption in today’s environments is growing rapidly and poses challenges for tracing tools that intercept microservices’ RPC messages. Normal traffic sniffing collects the encrypted data and has no means to access the original payload. This inhibits traditional tracing tools and complicates debugging systems when critical issues arise.\r\n\r\nTo address this, eBPF tools probe user space to regain access to the plaintext data. While these approaches are exciting, scaling this type of instrumentation presents a new set of difficulties due to the variety of library choices, possible versions of each library and type of linking.\r\n\r\nWe present the techniques developed to reliably trace TLS applications across a wide array of conditions found in real-life applications. This allows Pixie to trace both BoringSSL and OpenSSL and reduces the maintenance for supporting new library versions compared to the previous tracing. We conclude by noting the coverage challenges that remain and our future plans",

It performs dynamic application and container analysis in temporary containers collecting file system activity information and other telemetry from inside of those containers, which has technical limitations. eBPF is a great way to address these technical limitations making it possible to collect data from production environments.\r\n\r\nThe talk outlines a sensor design and the eBPF hooks it needs to collect the necessary file system activity telemetry exploring different implementation options and then showing how Tetragon, a Kubernetes-aware eBPF-based runtime observability and enforcement tool,  implements the design, how it works and its key interfaces.\r\n",

However it's less straightforward to use eBPF for a proactive defense, stopping attacks immediately rather than simply alerting SOC analysts that concerning things are happening on a machine. Is this possible within the limitations of eBPF?\r\n\r\nThis session showcases a proof-of-concept that uses eBPF to detect and even prevent stack pivoting, a popular ROP exploitation technique. We'll briefly review ROP exploitation and stack pivots, and explore the possibility of using eBPF to kill ROP exploits using stack pivots as they happen.",

The main implications to be discussed are kprobe misses, and potential map entry leak.\r\n\r\nFor socket filters, the implications of re-entrancy will be covered. Moreover, some features of the execution environment will be discussed which may be used for implementing mitigations.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk will be to inform users more about the guarantees provided by the kernel for eBPF programs, and the wider context within which the programs run.\r\n",

Because eBPF provides low-overhead observability and the means to modify system state at a fine grain (per socket policies etc), it is a great fit for this problem space. Currently bpftune focuses on networking-related tunables as a starting point but it is pluggable and extensible. Here we aim to describe the goals of bpftune, methods used and discuss possible future directions.  Some of the methods used may be of more general interest; for example online correlational analysis in eBPF is a useful technique that can help automate observability-driven decision-making and drilldown. In addition, bpftune showcases a number of types of eBPF programs so the availability of the code may hopefully help developers learning eBPF too.",

              "description": "Typically we think of BPF as JIT'ing programs at load time.  Such JIT is great for many purposes, but doesn't work when a Type-1 hypervisor requires signed pages before allowing them to be loaded, when signing keys are offline.  This security feature, sometimes known as HyperVisor-enforced Code Integrity (HVCI) is common in Windows environments.  In this talk, we will present recent work to allow eBPF to be used to create native drivers that work with HVCI, and also allow kernel debuggers to work normally with BPF programs as a result, improving the developer experience.",

Taking Cilium as an example, Joe will walk through how eBPF helped solve challenges around networking, observability, and security in the cloud native world. Each example will highlight how eBPF allows us to rethink the way we solve problems and how eBPF lets us build a fundamentally better kernel.",
