title: "eBPF Updates #2: eBPF with Zig, libbpf-bootstrap, Rust Linker, BTF in Kernel Modules, Cgroup-Based Memory Accounting"
description: "Welcome to the second issue of the _eBPF Updates_! This time we have
interesting resources about how to write eBPF programs with Zig, or with Rust,
or on how to manage them with libbpf. On the kernel side, modules now support
BTF, and improvements to memory accounting for eBPF should help to solve the
limitations of rlimit. Did this just sound incomprehensible to you? Do not
fear, we also have some gentle introductions to eBPF in the list. This issue
also introduces a “Did You Know” section, and this time the focus is on CO-RE.
Read, learn, trace, and filter!"
