description: "Spring is back in the Northern Hemisphere, and with it all kinds of features
are blooming for eBPF. Kernel 5.12 is out and version 5.13 is on track to
bring new exciting functionalities. At the same time, new projects hatch and
companies are enjoying renewed activity. Several eBPF-related projects applied
to join or upgrade their status in the bosom of CNCF. After some delay, no
doubt caused by winter hibernation, welcome to the fifth issue of the eBPF
Updates!"
