title: 'eBPF Updates #3: Atomics Operations, Socket Options Retrieval, Syscall Tracing Benchmarks, eBPF in the Supply Chain'
description: "With the festive season, it would seem that eBPF blogging has cooled down a
little, and we have fewer items to report this time. But eBPF is getting
traction everywhere, so we can be confident that more material will be
available for the months to come. Let's wager that 2021 will be full of new
features, tutorials, deep dives, commercial news, and good surprises in
general. In the meantime, here are all the latest news. Welcome to the third
issue of the eBPF Updates, and Happy New Year!"
