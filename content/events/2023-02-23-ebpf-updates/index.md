title: 'eBPF Updates #4: In-Memory Loads Detection, Debugging QUIC, Local CI Runs, MTU Checks, but No Pancakes'
description: "In several parts of the globe, February is traditionally about love, and
pancakes. eBPF sure received a lot of love over the last weeks! Blogging,
conferencing, and kernel development have resumed full speed after the quiet
period at the end of the year. Here are all the latest updates, plus a section
focusing on program size limits. Alas, uncertainty remains as for eBPF getting
pancakes."
